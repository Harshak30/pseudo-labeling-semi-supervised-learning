## **Semi-Supervised learning**
Semi-Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that represents the intermediate ground between Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms. 
It uses the combination of labeled and unlabeled datasets during the training period.
The data that consists of a few labels, it mostly consists of unlabeled data. 
Initially, similar data is clustered along with an unsupervised learning algorithm, and further, it helps to label the unlabeled data into labeled data.

## **Pseudo Labeling**
In this technique, instead of manually labeling the unlabelled data, we give approximate labels on the basis of the labelled data. Labeling steps are shown in the image below.
